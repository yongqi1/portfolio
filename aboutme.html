<p>About Me:</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Yongqi and I am a senior at Alameda Science & Technology Institute. This summer, I will be a part of the 2017 Bay Area Autodesk Summer Immersion Program. I am looking forward to what the program has to offer and the many opportunities that I will get to experience. On my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, traveling, photography, and using photoshop. I live in the Easy Bay but I often portfolio/aboutme.html to San Francisco through bart.</p>

<h4>Differences/Similarities between Scratch and Python</h4>
<p> On Scratch you cans see the different functions and colored blocks, while on Python you have to write these functions using lines of code yourself. Scratch has colors that differentiate the many functions and loops. You can write and customize text better on Python. </p>

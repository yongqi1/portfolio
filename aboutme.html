<p>About Me:</p>
<p>Short Biography:
Hello! My name is Yongqi and I am a senior at Alameda Science & Technology Institute. This summer, I will be a part of the 2017 Bay Area Autodesk Summer Immersion Program. I am looking forward to what the program has to offer and the many opportunities that I will get to experience. On my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, traveling, photography, and using photoshop. I live in the Easy Bay but I often commute to San Francisco through bart.</p>
